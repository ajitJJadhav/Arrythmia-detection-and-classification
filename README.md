# Arrythmia-detection-and-classification
Arrythmia detection using R peaks detection and classification 
based on the R peak positions.

A condition in which the heart beats with an irregular or
abnormal rhythm is known as Arrhythmia. This project presents a
procedure to extract information from Electrocardiogram (ECG)
data & determine types of Arrhythmias. The decisions were
achieved by determining different factors such as RR Interval,
Heart Rate (HR) etc. and those factors were compared with the
ideal intervals. During the whole process MATLAB was used &
ECG signals were taken from MIT-BIH database. In this process
FFT filter was used to reduce the noise of the signal.
Supraventricular Tachycardia, Bradycardia, Premature
Ventricular Contraction, missed beats were detected during this
analysis. The results show simplified detection of arrhythmia
with 90% accuracy.
